# 📘 What is LangChain?

LangChain is an **open-source framework** designed to help developers build applications powered by **Large Language Models (LLMs)** such as GPT, Claude, or LLaMA.  
Instead of interacting with an LLM in isolation, LangChain provides tools and integrations to connect the LLM with **data sources, APIs, and memory**, making applications more **context-aware, dynamic, and powerful**.

## 🚀 Why Use LangChain?

- **Framework for LLM Apps**  
  Simplifies building AI-powered apps like chatbots, agents, knowledge assistants, and workflow automators.

- **Integration with External Data**  
  Fetch and use data from databases, APIs, documents, or even real-time sources.

- **Memory Support**  
  Retain conversational context across multiple interactions (chatbots with memory).

- **Chains & Agents**  
  Combine multiple LLM calls, tools, and steps into a single workflow.

- **Open-Source & Extensible**  
  Works with various models (OpenAI, Hugging Face, Cohere, Anthropic, etc.).

## 🏗️ Core Concepts

### 1. **LLMs**
Interfaces for interacting with language models like GPT-4, LLaMA, etc.

### 2. **Prompt Templates**
Reusable templates for consistent, structured prompts.

### 3. **Chains**
Link multiple components (LLM + data + logic) together into a workflow.  
Example: *Take user query → Search database → Summarize with LLM → Return answer*.

### 4. **Agents**
Dynamic decision-makers that can choose which tool or API to use based on user input.

### 5. **Memory**
Allows apps to "remember" previous interactions (like real conversations).

### 6. **Data Loaders & Retrievers**
Helps fetch and chunk external data (PDFs, SQL, Notion, Google Drive, etc.) for use with LLMs.

## 📦 Example Use Cases

- 🤖 **AI Chatbots** – Customer support, Q&A systems, personal assistants.  
- 📚 **Knowledge Assistants** – Query documents, PDFs, or websites.  
- ⚙️ **Task Automation** – Email drafting, report generation, coding helpers.  
- 🔍 **Information Retrieval** – Semantic search over custom datasets.  
- 💡 **Prototyping AI Apps** – Quickly test new LLM-powered workflows.

## 💻 Simple Example (Python)

```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

# Initialize LLM
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.7)

# Create a prompt template
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("Translate this text to French: {text}")

# Build a chain
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

# Run the chain
result = chain.run("Hello, how are you?")
print(result)  # → "Bonjour, comment ça va ?"
```
