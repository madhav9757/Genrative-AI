## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Transformers Library** – Pretrained models for text, images, audio, and more.  
  *Examples:* GPT, BERT, T5, RoBERTa  
  *Use cases:* text generation, summarization, translation, question-answering, sentiment analysis

- **Model Hub** – Thousands of pretrained AI models ready to use or fine-tune.  
  Think of it like **GitHub for AI models**.

- **Datasets & Tools** – Ready-to-use datasets, tokenizers, evaluation tools, and pipelines.

- **Spaces** – Host and share AI apps (web demos) built with Hugging Face models.
