# 📝 Prompt Engineering

**Prompt Engineering** is the practice of designing and optimizing prompts (instructions) to get the best possible output from a generative AI model (like ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, etc.).

Since LLMs generate responses based on the input they receive, the way you write the prompt heavily affects the quality, accuracy, and usefulness of the answer.

## ⚡ Why It Matters

- **Bad prompt** → vague, irrelevant, or wrong answer.  
- **Good prompt** → clear, structured, accurate, and creative output.

### Example
❌ Bad:  
> Explain AI.  

✅ Good:  
> Explain Artificial Intelligence in simple words, using a real-world example, in under 100 words.

## 🔑 Types of Prompt Engineering

### 1. Zero-Shot Prompting
You give the model a task directly without examples.  
**Example:**  
> Translate this sentence into French: Hello, how are you?

---

### 2. One-Shot Prompting
You give **one example** to guide the model.  
**Example:**  
```
English: Good morning → French: Bonjour  
English: How are you? → French:  
```

---

### 3. Few-Shot Prompting
You give **a few examples** so the model learns the pattern.  
**Example:**  
```
English: Good morning → French: Bonjour  
English: How are you? → French: Comment ça va?  
English: I love you → French:  
```

---

### 4. Chain-of-Thought Prompting (CoT)
Ask the model to **show reasoning step-by-step**.  
**Example:**  
> Solve this math problem step by step: 23 × 17 = ?

---

### 5. Role-Based Prompting
Tell the AI to act as a specific **role/persona**.  
**Example:**  
> You are a teacher. Explain neural networks to a 10-year-old using a simple analogy.

---

### 6. Instruction-Based Prompting
Clearly tell the model **how to structure** its answer.  
**Example:**  
> Give me 3 bullet points explaining blockchain, each under 15 words.

---

### 7. Contextual Prompting
Provide **background info** so the AI tailors the answer.  
**Example:**  
> I am preparing for a Data Structures exam. Explain stacks in simple terms with an example in Java.

---

### 8. Conversational Prompting
Used in **chatbots** → maintain memory of conversation.  
**Example:**  
- Q: Who is the president of India?  
- Q: Where was he born? → AI understands "he".
