# 🌐 Neural Network (NN)

A **Neural Network** is a type of **machine learning model** inspired by how the **human brain** works.  
It’s made up of layers of interconnected units called **neurons (nodes)**, which process and pass information.

Think of it like a **network of tiny calculators** that work together to **learn patterns in data**.

## 🔑 Basic Structure

- **Input Layer** → Takes the raw data (e.g., image pixels, words, numbers).  
- **Hidden Layers** → Perform computations. Each neuron applies **weights**, **biases**, and an **activation function**.  
- **Output Layer** → Produces the final prediction (e.g., “cat” or “dog”, next word, price prediction).

## ⚙️ How It Works (Step by Step)

1. Input comes in → e.g., pixels of an image or words in a sentence.  
2. Each neuron applies:  
3. An **activation function** decides whether the neuron should “fire” (pass info).  
- Common ones: **ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh**  
4. Data flows forward layer by layer until it reaches the output.  
5. **Learning happens** by adjusting weights using **backpropagation + optimization (gradient descent)**.

## 🎯 Example

If you train a neural network with cat 🐱 and dog 🐶 images:  

- **Input Layer** → Image pixels  
- **Hidden Layers** → Learn edges, shapes, fur patterns  
- **Output Layer** →  

90% Cat 🐱
10% Dog 🐶

## 🚀 Types of Neural Networks

- **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)** → Simple input-to-output flow  
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** → Image recognition, visual patterns  
- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN, LSTM, GRU)** → Sequences (text, speech)  
- **Transformers** → Modern architecture (used in GPT, BERT, etc.)

## ⚡ In Short

A **Neural Network** is an **AI system that mimics the brain**, built from layers of connected neurons.  
It **learns patterns from data** and uses them to **predict, generate, or classify information**.
